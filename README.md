Hey! Like MatrixSDK? Awesome! We could actually really use your help!

Open source isn't just writing code. MatrixSDK could use your help with any of the
following:

- New feature suggestions.
- Answering questions on issues.
- Documentation improvements.
- Reviewing pull requests.
- Helping to manage issue priorities.
- Fixing bugs/new features.

If any of that sounds cool to you, send a pull request! After a few
contributions, we'll add you as an admin to the repo so you can merge pull
requests and help steer the ship :ship:
